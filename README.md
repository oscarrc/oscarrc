## So you want to know more about me, uh?

Well, I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, but I also enjoy solving my own problems with programming. This interest started back in 2012 when I started a Wordpress blog to earn some pasive income through adSense for which I coded my own theme.

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an elearning company, a crypto start-up, a legal corporation, and as a freelancer. My main focus these days is building accessible, and usable products to try and make people life easier.

Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Node.js
* React
* Next.js
* Solidity
* Web3.js
